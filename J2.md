1.  + Any public number or field in the parent class can be accessed by any other class. Private fields are inherited by the child class but can't be called on directly. 
    + The same is true for the grandparent class. 
    + Anyone can see public no one can see private.
2.  Option 4. 
    + 1, 2, 3 fails no direct access to X and Y. 
    + 5 will run but it has no direct access to X and Y hence it is assigning values to local variables. 
    + Option 4 uses setXY which is public therefore it works.
3.  It won't compile since it is refering to variables super hasn't called yet.
4.  By calling super first it will compile.
5. Option 2 is the only one that will compile and override because all methods are public and unlike 4 where you're not overriding it you're just writing a new one it has the same name.
6. Behaves like a public field or method withing the inheritance hierarchy but outside that inhertance hierarchy it behaves ike its private.

10. A public static field makes sense when you need a gloshared bally accessible variable or method across the class. An example of this could be a user counter.
